  # FIXME FIXME FIXME: 2020-05-21: 'loop' should be '2, 1' but there's some
  # nightmarish bug in CI wherein reboots hang forever. There's a bug open[1]
  # but it seems dead. Without a working reboot, there's no way to test v1.
  #  [1] https://redhat.service-now.com/surl.do?n=PNT0808530
  # I'm leaving this as a 'loop' in (foolish? vain?) hope that the bug will
  # be fixed. Let's revisit this after, say, 2020-08. If the bug persists
  # then let's just revert the entire cgroups v1 change, and go back to
  # using standard-test-basic.
